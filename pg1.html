<h1>I my not very log life I had a lot of hobbies</h1>
<p>
    <h3>As you know I'm very active teen. So from 1st grade to 3rd grade is was into dancing but I start hating it very soon
    and leave dancing.</br>
    After that in 4th grade a start programing a robots which I build from Lego and that was really fun but at that time
    my family can't afford that hobby so I needed to stop and that was very sad. But I understand why that happen
    so I
    start searching new hobby.</br>  And at 5th grade I start programing and learning PC and since that time this is my
    hobby
    which I think will become my life way.</br>
    Now my hobby is jumping from different objects with bike and mix fighting. So that is it. Now you can get on main
    page with knowing all about me. </br></h3>
    <h2>See you next time.</h2>
